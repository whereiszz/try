    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>If you would like to add an offset to the top of the container or player you may add an extra action object to the array. For this example, from 0 to 30% of the container, the Lottie will be stopped and from 30% to 100% of the container the Lottie will be synced with the scroll. In cases where you would like the animation to loop from a specific frame to a specific frame, you can add an additional object to actions in which you can specify the frames. In the example below, the Lottie loops frame 45 to 60 once 45% of the container is reached.</p>
